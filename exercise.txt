Exercise (to be done in Node or Meteor, use Github)

Choose just one option:

Option 1. Create a simple chat application that allow two users to communicate with each other.
Bonus*: count how long did the conversation lasted (start/end time).

Option 2. Create a simple application to show Twitter feeds. Allow the user to save his preferred tweets and see them later.
Bonus*: allow the user to search specific words in his saved tweets.

* optional - if you have time and/or know how to do it. You can also just discuss how you would implement it.


Have fun! =)
